## Abstract 
<!-- (50-60 words) -->


## Research Questions  <!--(50-60 words)-->
1. Can Transport Mode Detection for the pooled POSMO tracking data be improved using (a) the stepwise procedure described in Sadeghian et al (2022) and with (b) public transport timetables
2. How reliable is the public transport around Wädenswil according to the timetables?

## Results / products
<!-- What do you expect, anticipate? -->


## Data
<!-- What data will you use? Will you require additional context data? Where do you get this data from? Do you already have all the data? -->

## Analytical concepts
<!-- Which analytical concepts will you use? What conceptual movement spaces and respective modelling approaches of trajectories will you be using? What additional spatial analysis methods will you be using? -->

**Improved Transport Mode Detection**

*1. Noise reduction*
The tracking data from the pool of POSMO app data is combined, cleaned, outliers are removed and the data is resampled to have a consistent timelag between points. The parameters for these steps are derived from repeated Explorative Data Analysis by Visialization and descriptive statistics. 
*2. Segmentation*
*3. Features extraction*
*4. Unsupervised algorithm*
*5. spatial Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (sMCDA)*
*6. Supervised learning algorithms* 

**Punctuality Evaluation of public transport**
*7. *

## R concepts
