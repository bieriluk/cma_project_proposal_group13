## Abstract 
<!-- (50-60 words) -->


## Research Questions  <!--(50-60 words)-->
1. Can Transport Mode Detection for the pooled POSMO tracking data be improved using (a) the stepwise procedure described in Sadeghian et al (2022) and with (b) public transport timetables
2. How reliable is the public transport around Wädenswil according to the timetables?
